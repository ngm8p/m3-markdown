# Exercise-2

As described in [module-4](https://github.com/INFO-201/m4-git-intro), you should begin by forking this repository, then cloning it to your local machine (if you haven't already).

In the space below, you'll provide some information about a terminal command you've learned thus far in the class. In particular, you should include the following:

A heading with the name of the command An example of how it can be used (with appropriate code highlighting) A nested list of information about the command (i.e., things that it does, or how it can be used)

cp

The cp command can be used to copy a file or folder. For example:

cp my-photo.png my-photo2.png
Here's some more information about the cp command:

It can be used to recursively copy a directory with the -R option: cp -R folder-1 folder-2
You can print out progress to the terminal using the -v command, making it verbose): cp -R -v folder-1 folder-2
See complete branch for answers.

# cd

The 'cd' command can be used to change the directory/folder which you are in. For example:

If you are currently in the 'Documents' directory and would like to move to a directory in 'Documents' called 'AwesomeFolder', you would type 'cd AwesomeFolder' in your terminal.

Here's some more information about the 'cd' command:

- Simply typing 'cd' in the terminal will take you to the root folder in the file system
- Type 'cd ..' to navigate up/out of a directory
